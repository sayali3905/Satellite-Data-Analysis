**Satellite Data Analysis** <br/>
In this project, we analysed the satellite data of Almatti Dam collected by Sentinel-2. Many satellite images were covered by clouds, thus we used GANs to remove clouds that cover satellite images and generate data for the masked region(i.e., after the cloud removal process).
